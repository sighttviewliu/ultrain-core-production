INSTALLING THE PBC LIBRARY
==========================

The PBC library needs the GMP library, which can be found at:

  https://gmplib.org/

On Debian-based systems, simply run:

  $ sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev

This build system has been tested and works on Linux and Mac OS X with a
fink installation.  You may need to specify paths via LDFLAGS and
CPPFLAGS if libraries are located in places other than the default
assumed in configure.ac.  See ./configure --help for more information.

./configure
make
make install
