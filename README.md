# ULTRAIN - Decentralized Engine for The Future

Welcome to the ULTRAIN source code repository!

Ultrain's goal is to provide a high-performance and high-security blockchain operating system to
support massive business DAPPs. To achieve that, the design of Ultrain system has the following
features:

1. Permissionless open blockchain network.
1. Random-POS based consensus with high-performance, deterministic finality and quick block confirmation (~10s).
1. Smart contract platform powered by Web Assembly
1. Widely adopted developing language TypeScript.
1. Multi-chain design with smart scheduling for best balance between performance & security.
1. Well designed token economy for predictable DAPPs cost & lucrative mining reward.
